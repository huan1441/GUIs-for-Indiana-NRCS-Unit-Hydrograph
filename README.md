# GUIs for Indiana NRCS Unit Hydrograph (Finley Unit Hydrograph)
These two graphical user interfaces (GUIs) developed based on Excel VBA and Python are used for generating the ordinates of Indiana NRCS unit hydrograph (referred as Finley UH to honor David Finley who inspired this study). The GUIs are associated with the technical report “[<b><i>Developing customized NRCS unit hydrographs (Finley UHs) for ungauged watersheds in Indiana</b></i>](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jtrp/1821/)”. For more details about the features of the GUIs, please refer to the user manual, [README.pdf](https://github.com/huan1441/GUIs-for-Indiana-NRCS-Unit-Hydrograph/blob/main/README.pdf), in the current repository.
